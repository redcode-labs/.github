# Introduction
First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Red Code Labs. It's people like you that make our open-source solutions so great! Please, read the below guidelines if you want to contribute towards any of our projects. 

### What kind of contributions we're looking for? 
Red Code Labs is an open source friendly organization, and we love to receive contributions from everyone. There are many ways which you can contribute, for example, but not limited to:
* bug reports
* feature requests
* writing docs
* general quality of code fixes and/or improvements

### What kind of contributions we're NOT looking for?
Please, don't use any issue tracker for any form of support/'how to' questions. Feel free to ping our team on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NCdzvava7J), so we can help you personally. If your issue is not strictly related to our tools, but rather the toolkits behind it (such as, for example: Golang), Golang-related channels might be more active and more helpful. Keep in mind that we're also merely a bunch of humans, not masterminds who have sacred knowledge of every toolkit that we make use of. 

### What is expected from you? 
Keep in mind, that not all kinds of changes might be approved. 
We can also take a while, before taking a look at your proposed changes/issues.
Be welcome towards everyone discussing your issue/pull request/whatever. 

### What now?
You're ready to make your first contribution. Feel free to ask for help; keep in mind that we still consider ourselves sort of beginners, so don't be too harsh on yourself neither. 

## MISC

### How to report a security vulnerability?
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue, email us instead: `redcode@redcodelabs.dev`
There are not a lot of projects in our org which *might* contain such vulnerabilities, however, one such example might be easyWSL, which was published to the MS Store. If you don't know if you're dealing with a security vulnerability, ask yourself: does this tool do something, that it's not meant to do, or in a way that enhances risk level for it's user? If you're unsure - feel free to email us anyway.

### How to report a bug? 
You can use the bug reporting template via issue on any given repo. Please keep in mind to include as many details as possible. 

### How to suggest a feature or enhancement?
You can use the feature request/enhacement template via issue tracker. However, keep in mind that not all kinds of features will be implemented, but we will always take them into account and discuss them. Scoping the feature, thinking it through, explaining why it's needed, and especially providing info on how that might work is welcome. 

### How do we review issues/pull requests?
As said, it can take some time on our end, however, we are aware of every opened issue/pull request, and discuss it internally, as well as with you, if that'd be required (not the case for very simple contributions, such as correcting spelling error in the README of the project)

### Where can I discuss with you, besides from GitHub?
You can use our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NCdzvava7J) server, feel free to ping us, but don't overuse that permission. 

### Any conventions I need to follow?
Generally speaking for the code - just follow language-specific code style. 
For commit messages - just a simple "fix something", "bump deps", or "update something" is more than good enough, we don't have any strict rules on that matter. 
For issues - we have templates to follow before submitting any (that is, either bug or feature request) kind of feature.
